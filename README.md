# KinematicEquationsProbSolver

These programs use random (And user-generated) input in order to solve projectile motion problem using kinematic equations.

In order to run them, you'll need Python 2.7 or Python 3.X.X. The initial versions were written in Py 2.7 and Py 3.6.1 respectively.

Shoutout to https://github.com/JulianaTh for helping me to work out the math equations that the programs rely on.
